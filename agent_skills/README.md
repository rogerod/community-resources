### Accessibility

#### apca-compliance-figma

[SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/Merkle-XDI/apca-compliance-figma) · [MIT](https://github.com/Merkle-XDI/apca-compliance-figma/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)
**MCP Tools:** `get_design_context` `get_variable_defs` `get_screenshot` `use_figma`.

### Components

#### design-react-api

[SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/bitovi/design-react-api) · [MIT](https://github.com/bitovi/design-react-api/blob/main/LICENSE)
**MCP Tools:** `get_design_context` `get_variable_defs`                                                                          
A spec-driven skill that analyzes a Figma component and proposes a React component API, props interface, TypeScript types, and  
variant-to-prop mappings before any implementation begins.                                                                                       

#### reconstruct-component-figma

[SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/JP4000000/reconstruct-component-figma) · [MIT](https://github.com/JP4000000/reconstruct-component-figma/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)
**MCP Tools:** `get_design_context` `get_screenshot` `use_figma`
A skill that takes a selected Figma frame and rebuilds it as a proper Atomic Design component system directly on the Figma canvas, without Code Connect or a published library.

### Design Generation

#### bridge-ds

[SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/noemuch/bridge) · [MIT](https://github.com/noemuch/bridge/blob/main/LICENSE)
**MCP Tools:** `use_figma` `get_design_context` `get_screenshot` `get_variable_defs` `search_design_system` `get_metadata`
A skill that generates Figma designs fully bound to your design system. Extracts components, variables, and text styles into a local knowledge base, then compiles declarative scene graphs into Figma Plugin API code executed via MCP. All output uses real component instances, bound variables, and token references — no hardcoded values. Includes a recipe system that learns from corrections to improve future generations.
